There are two crawlers 'spidey' and 'zeus'

1.'spidey' is scraping item numbers and it asks for urls.txt, 
you're to put the leaf urls in that text file
and then run it as " scrapy crawl spidey -o yourfilename.csv -t csv "

2.'zeus' is scraping images, price, breadcrums, title, description etc.
It asks for itemNumbers.txt, 
you're to put item numbers(that you scraped from 'spidey') in that text file
and then run it as " scrapy crawl zeus -o yourfilename.csv -t csv "

Note: I have already put samples in 'urls.txt' & 'itemNumbers.txt' for your understanding! 
Remove the samples(not the text files) after checking and paste there yours.
Cheers!
